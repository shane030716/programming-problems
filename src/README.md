### [BiNode Conversion](BiNodeConversion.java)

Convert a Binary Tree to an 'in-order' double-linked list, where the left child represents previous element and the right child represent next element

Example Input: 
```
         8
       /   \
      4     10
     / \      \
    1   5     15
         \    /
          7  12
```
Output:
```
1 <-> 4 <-> 5 <-> 7 <-> 8 <-> 10 <-> 12 <-> 15
```
